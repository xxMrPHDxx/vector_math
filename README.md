# vector_math library for glfw and glew

This library contains vec3, vec4, mat3 and mat4 with default type of float.
I didn't bother using template to create generic type of them because I 
don't use other types anyway.

## How to build
`cmake --config=Release . && make`

## How to install
`cmake --config=Release . && make install`
